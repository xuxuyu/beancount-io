# Beancount.io Backend

## Overview

The backend is built with Node.js and TypeScript using Koa and GraphQL. It powers the API and background jobs for Beancount.io. Key features include:

- GraphQL APIs served via Apollo Server and Koa
- TypeScript for a type-safe codebase
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Redis for caching
- Background jobs for data processing

## Getting Started

This guide assumes a Unix-like environment. If you are on Windows, see [Run on Windows](#run-on-windows).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bex-co/beancount-io.git
cd beancount-io/backend-cluster/backend-v2
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the necessary environment variables. Required variables include:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_BACKEND_URI=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/beancount
REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379
FAVA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
FAVA_API_ADMIN_USER=admin
FAVA_API_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
AUTH_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# Production sibling domains: shared parent domain, for example .example.com
AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4104
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:5173
# Optional: login/register JWT lifetime in minutes (default 525600 = 365 days)
# AUTH_JWT_EXP_MINUTES=5
```

Production OAuth requires `OAUTH_JWKS`, a complete private P-256/ES256 signing
JWKS provided by the deployment secret manager. It must never be committed or
copied into `.env.example`. When it is absent or malformed, OAuth endpoints
return `503 oauth_not_configured`; the existing API and legacy JWT login remain
available. Development and tests generate an ephemeral process-local key.

Rotate an OAuth signing key by installing the replacement secret, deploying it,
and removing the replaced public key from the served JWKS. Deleting a historical
private key from Git without replacing the accepted live key does not invalidate
tokens signed with it.

### OAuth deployment contract

`DASHBOARD_URL` is the public authorization-server and consent front door in
production. `SERVER_URL` is the direct backend URL used by the local development
stack. They are normal public deployment configuration, not OAuth secrets. Both
default to the official service in production; development defaults to the
local backend and dashboard. HTTPS is mandatory except for `localhost`,
`127.0.0.1`, or `::1` outside production. If a production reverse proxy
publishes Beancount under a path prefix, include that prefix in `DASHBOARD_URL`
without a trailing slash.

The localhost stack uses different ports but the same hostname. Production
deployments should normally expose both through one HTTPS front door.

Discovery starts at the RFC 9728 URL derived from the API resource. For an
issuer `https://books.example.test/beancount`, the API resource and discovery
chain are:

```text
resource: https://books.example.test/beancount/v1
protected resource metadata:
  https://books.example.test/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/beancount/v1
authorization server metadata:
  https://books.example.test/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/beancount
```

The proxy must route those well-known paths, the issuer-prefixed
`/api-gateway/oauth/*` endpoints, and the interaction pages to this backend and
dashboard respectively. The static `beancount-mobile` client is public (no
secret), accepts only authorization code plus refresh grants, requires S256
PKCE, and registers only `io.beancount.ios:/oauth/callback` and
`io.beancount.android:/oauth/callback`.

OAuth capabilities use one closed operation matrix on GraphQL, REST, and MCP:
reads require `ledger.read`, ordinary mutations require
`ledger.write`, and destructive account/ledger operations plus collaborator or
public-key management require `ledger.admin`. These scopes are independent; an
admin credential does not implicitly gain read or write access. Legacy browser
and installed-mobile session JWTs remain capability-exempt only for the stated
migration window.

Signing-key rotation is a two-step deployment: replace the secret-backed JWKS,
deploy, then verify `/api-gateway/oauth/jwks` exposes the new public `kid` only.
Tokens signed by a removed key stop authenticating immediately. Never place the
private JWK or a token in logs, commands captured by CI, or committed files.

Refresh-token revocation prevents another refresh but does not maintain a
per-request denylist for already-issued self-contained access tokens. Their
maximum lifetime is one hour (`ttl.AccessToken`); clients must clear their local
copy immediately on logout and operators should use signing-key rotation only
for incident response where immediate global invalidation is required.

#### Git over SSH proxy (optional, ADR 0004)

Backend-v2 can serve git over SSH itself instead of Gitea, so that the
main-only rule and every application-layer check apply to SSH as well as HTTP.
It authenticates the client against the keys Gitea holds, then speaks
git-over-HTTP to Gitea with that user's own credentials — no key of ours is
stored or registered anywhere. It stays off unless **both** `SSH_PROXY_ENABLED`
and `SSH_PROXY_HOST_KEY` are set:

```dotenv
SSH_PROXY_ENABLED=false
SSH_PROXY_PORT=2222
SSH_PROXY_HOST_KEY=
```

#### Free-tier directive limit (ADR 0005)

The proxy also enforces the free-tier directive cap, replacing the last Gitea
pre-receive hook. It asks ledger-v2 what the ledger currently counts and refuses
a push whose ledger is already over — the question it _cannot_ answer is whether
a push would take it over, because a thin pack carries no object store.

There is no switch. It fails **open** on any error instead: once the hook is
gone, deleting entries through the app is an over-limit user's only way back
under, so a check that failed closed would lock both doors at once.

`SSH_PROXY_HOST_KEY` should hold **Gitea's existing** host private key.
Presenting a new one on a port clients have used before produces
`REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED` — indistinguishable from an attack —
and git refuses to continue. Retrieve the key with
`_infra/print-ssh-host-key.sh`; it is a private key, so it belongs only in an
uncommitted `.env`.

### Run on Windows

We recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). After installing WSL,
open a terminal and follow the same installation steps. If you prefer
PowerShell, make sure `nvm` and Git Bash are available before running the
commands.

## Development

### Start the Server

To run the server in development mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

The server will be available at the port specified in your configuration (default: 4104).

### Available Scripts

- `yarn start`: Start the server using ts-node
- `yarn server`: Start the server using Node.js (requires build first)
- `yarn lint`: Run ESLint to check and fix code style issues
- `yarn kill`: Kill the node server occupying port 4104
- `yarn backfill-empty-locale`: Run script to backfill empty locale data
- `yarn backfill-user-activated`: Run script to backfill user activation status

### Job Scheduler

Background jobs are scheduled using node-cron and run automatically when the server starts:

- **JWT Cleanup**: Runs daily at midnight (00:00) to delete expired tokens from PostgreSQL
- **Dev Test Job**: Runs every 5 minutes in development mode (console.log test)

See `src/scheduler/` for implementation details and `src/scheduler/README.md` for information on adding new jobs.

## API Documentation

The backend exposes GraphQL APIs through Apollo Server. You can explore the API schema by running the server and visiting the GraphQL playground.
